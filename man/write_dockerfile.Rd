\usage{
write_dockerfile(base = NULL, path = ".",
  maintainer = getOption("usethis.full_name"), r_date = NULL)
}
\arguments{
\item{base}{Your Docker base. I recommend that you use a binder base from the
\href{https://www.rocker-project.org/images/}{rocker project}. This daily
image will contain all the Jupyter hub elements + Rstudio Server + the
tidyverse (which cuts down on installation time). The only thing then left
to do is to install any additional packages listed in your DESCRIPTION
file, which will be done during the build_binder step.}

\item{path}{path to binder repo. Defaults to current location.}

\item{maintainer}{Maintainer of the Dockerfile. By default the function reads
`usethis.full_name` set in Options. The same information is used to set the
author on your DESCRIPTION file.  For more information on setting up
default values for Description files, reasd the
\href{https://usethis.r-lib.org/articles/articles/usethis-setup.html#store-default-values-for-description-fields-and-other-preferences}{Rstudio usethis
documentation}.}

\item{r_date}{The date for which you'd like to lock down this project.
Projects that match current release date go to "latest". This will be
automatically determined from your code, so the recommendation is not to
override this unless you have a specific reason to do so. Date must be in ISO 8601 format.}
