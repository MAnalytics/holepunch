# Hole punch 

[![Travis build status](https://travis-ci.org/karthik/holepunch.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/karthik/holepunch) [![Lifecycle: maturing](https://img.shields.io/badge/lifecycle-maturing-blue.svg)](https://www.tidyverse.org/lifecycle/#maturing) 

 
## Motivation 
[Binder](https://mybinder.org/) is an open source project that can take ~~any~~ most GitHub repos of notebooks (R or Jupyter) and turn them into a free, live instance that not only has all dependencies ready to go but also provides Jupyter or Rstudio server to run the code on. The instances are small and should not be used to demonstrate resource intensive computation. However they are ideal for reproducing papers/figures/examples and make a great addition to any public analysis project that is being hosted on GitHub.

## Why this is awesome

- You can launch a free instance of Rstudio server from any of your projects on GitHub. The instance will have all of your dependencies and version of R installed and ready to go!
- Easily allow anyone (up to 100 simultaneous users) to replicate or modify your analysis
- Free

## Limitations

- The server has limited ram and you cannot load large datasets or run big computations
- Binder is meant for interactive and ephemeral interactive coding so an instance will die after 10 minutes of inactivity.
- An instance cannot be kept alive for more than 12 hours

## Installation

```r
remotes::install_github("karthik/holepunch")
# Please report any installation problems in the issues
```


## Setting up your project as a compendium (recommended)

If you are unfamiliar with the idea of research compendia, I highly recommend reading this paper by Marwick et al:

*Marwick B, Boettiger C, Mullen L. 2018. [Packaging data analytical work reproducibly using R (and friends)](https://peerj.com/preprints/3192/) PeerJ Preprints 6:e3192v2 https://doi.org/10.7287/peerj.preprints.3192v2*

and also looking through my [presentation at RStudio::conf 2019](http://inundata.org/talks/rstd19/#/) where I talk about this in detail.


```r
library(holepunch)
write_compendium_description(package = "Your compendium name", 
                             description = "Your compendium description")
# to write a description, with dependencies listed 
# It's good practice to now go fill in the placeholder text.

write_dockerfile(maintainer = "your_name") 
# To write a dockerfile. It will automatically pick the date of the last modified file, match it to 
# that version of R and add it here. You can override this by passing r_date to some arbitrary date
# (but one for which a R version exists).

generate_badge()
# This generates a badge for your readme.

# At this time ðŸ™Œ push the code to GitHub ðŸ™Œ

# And click on the badge or use the function below to get the build ready ahead of time.
build_binder()
# ðŸ¤žðŸš€
```

#### Alternate setup method

If for some reason you really don't want to set up your project as a compendium, then set it up by creating `runtime.txt` and `install.R`. This build will take a very long time.

```r
# Note that this particular approach will be super slow.
library(holepunch)
write_install()
# Writes install.r will all dependencies discovered in the folder
write_runtime()
# Writes a file with the current R date (proxy for version).
# Can be changed to any date by passing a date to r_date
generate_badge()

# At this time, commit the files to Github

# Then click the badge on your README or run

build_binder() # to kick off the build process
# ðŸ¤žðŸš€
```



## Testing this package

An easy way to test this package is to visit the [binder-test](https://github.com/karthik/binder-test) repo and follow the instructions. 



## Suggestions and review

The ETA for the first release of this package is early July. Comments, suggestions for improving the workflow or any other comments welcome in the issues.
